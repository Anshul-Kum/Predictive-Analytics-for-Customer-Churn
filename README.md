# Customer Churn Prediction
## Predictive Analytics for Customer Churn using Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning.

### Project Overview

This project delves into the Telco Customer Churn dataset from IBM to comprehend customer churn patterns and the underlying factors that contribute to it. Employing a comprehensive approach that encompasses data loading, cleansing, exploration, visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning, the project seeks to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends within the data. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for decision-makers to effectively mitigate customer churn.

**Methodology**

- Data Loading: The Telco Customer Churn dataset is loaded from its source and transformed into a usable format for analysis.

- Data Cleansing: The data is thoroughly cleansed to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the analysis.

- Data Exploration: Explored data to gain insights into the overall structure of the dataset.

- Data Visualization: Data visualizations are created to effectively communicate patterns, trends, and correlations within the data, aiding in the understanding of customer churn behavior.

- Feature Engineering: Relevant features are extracted, transformed, and combined to create informative features that enhance the predictive power of the machine learning models.

- Machine Learning Modeling: Three machine learning algorithms are evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting customer churn: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

- Model Evaluation: The performance of each machine learning model is rigorously evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to determine the most suitable model for predicting customer churn.

**Key Deliverables**

- Identification of key factors influencing customer churn

- Development of predictive models for customer churn

- Actionable insights for decision-makers to reduce customer churn

**Expected Outcomes**

- Enhanced understanding of customer churn patterns and contributing factors

- Improved ability to predict customer churn and identify at-risk customers
